                        Job Description:
                        We are seeking an IoT Embedded Systems Engineer to design, develop, and optimize embedded systems for IoT applications. The ideal candidate will have experience in embedded programming, sensor integration, and wireless communication protocols.

                        Responsibilities:
                        Develop firmware for IoT devices using C/C++ or Python.
                        Work with microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32, ARM Cortex).
                        Integrate sensors and peripherals via SPI, I2C, UART, and GPIO.
                        Optimize power consumption and system performance.
                        Ensure IoT security and data encryption.
                        Collaborate with cloud developers to integrate IoT devices with platforms like AWS IoT, Azure IoT, or Google Cloud IoT.
                        Requirements:
                        Bachelor's/Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field.
                        Strong experience with embedded C/C++ and RTOS.
                        Familiarity with wireless communication protocols (BLE, LoRa, Zigbee, MQTT).
                        Hands-on experience with IoT platforms and device-to-cloud communication.
                        Knowledge of PCB design and hardware debugging is a plus.
